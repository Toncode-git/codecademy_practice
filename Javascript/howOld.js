/*1.
Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, 
and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. Handle three different cases:

If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:
'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'

If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:
'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'

If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:
'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
*/

// Write your function here:

  const theCurrentYear = 2026;

const howOld = (age, year) => {
  const yearDifference = year - theCurrentYear;
  const newAge = age + yearDifference;

  if (newAge > age) {
    return 'You will be ' + newAge + ' in the year ' + year;
  } else if (newAge < 0) {
    return 'The year ' + year + ' was ' + (-newAge) + ' years before you were born';
  } else {
    return 'You were ' + newAge + ' in the year ' + year;
  }
};


// Once your function is written, write function calls to test your code!
console.log(howOld(24, 2005));
